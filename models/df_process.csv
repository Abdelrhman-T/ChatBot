[CLS] what is svd (singular value decomposition)? [SEP],[CLS] singular value decomposition (svd) is a factorization of a real or complex matrix that generalizes the eigendecomposition of a square normal matrix to any (m × n) matrix via an extension of the polar decomposition. [SEP]
[CLS] what is value passed by reference? [SEP],"[CLS] passing by reference means that a function receives a reference to the variable itself, rather than a copy of its value. this allows the function to modify the original variable's value directly. [SEP]"
[CLS] what is a transposed convolution layer? [SEP],"[CLS] transposed convolutions are used in convolutional neural networks to upsample input feature maps, often as part of a process to increase the resolution of images in tasks like image segmentation. [SEP]"
[CLS] what is deep learning? [SEP],[CLS] deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks with many layers (deep neural networks) to automatically learn hierarchical representations from large datasets. [SEP]
[CLS] what are labels in supervised learning? [SEP],[CLS] labels are the known outputs or target values in supervised learning. they are used during training to guide the model in learning the correct mapping between input features and output. [SEP]
[CLS] what is q-value? [SEP],"[CLS] in reinforcement learning, the q-value represents the quality of a particular action taken from a particular state. it provides the expected future rewards for that action taken in that state. [SEP]"
[CLS] what is polymorphism? [SEP],"[CLS] polymorphism in computer science refers to the ability of a function or an object to take on many forms. it allows methods to do different things based on the object it is acting upon, essential for achieving abstraction and flexibility in object-oriented programming.

[CLS] what is underfitting? [SEP],"[CLS] underfitting occurs when a model is too simple, failing to capture the underlying patterns in the data. [SEP]"
[CLS] what is pre-training and fine-tuning? [SEP],[CLS] pre-training refers to training a neural network model on a large dataset with a general-purpose task before it is fine-tuned on a specific task. this helps in improving the performance of the neural network on tasks that have smaller datasets.

[CLS] what is turing complete? [SEP],"[CLS] a system of data-manipulation rules (such as a computer's instruction set, a programming language, or a cellular automaton) is turing complete if it can be used to simulate any turing machine. this concept is used to determine the computational equivalence of different systems.

[CLS] what is underfitting? [SEP],"[CLS] underfitting occurs when a model is too simple, failing to capture the underlying patterns in the data. [SEP]"
[CLS] what is an artificial neural network (ann)? [SEP],"[CLS] an artificial neural network (ann) is a computational model inspired by biological neural networks. it consists of layers of interconnected nodes (neurons), where each neuron processes inputs and passes the output to the next layer. anns are the building blocks of deep learning models. [SEP]"
[CLS] what is positional encoding? [SEP],[CLS] positional encoding is used in transformer models to give the model information about the relative or absolute positioning of the tokens in the input sequences. [SEP]
[CLS] what is the transformer model and gpt? [SEP],"[CLS] the transformer model is a type of architecture that relies solely on attention mechanisms to draw global dependencies between input and output. the generative pre-trained transformer (gpt) is a version of transformer with a specific training method that uses unsupervised learning, which can then be fine-tuned with supervised learning tasks. [SEP]"
[CLS] what is mean squared error (mse)? [SEP],[CLS] mean squared error (mse) is a common loss function used in regression problems. it measures the average squared difference between the estimated values and what is estimated. [SEP]
[CLS] what is big-o notation? [SEP],[CLS] big-o notation is a mathematical notation that describes the limiting behavior of a function when the argument tends towards a particular value or infinity. it is a primary tool in computational complexity theory to classify algorithms according to how their run time or space requirements grow as the input size grows. [SEP]
[CLS] what are over-fitting and under-fitting? [SEP],[CLS] over-fitting occurs when a model learns the detail and noise in the training data to the extent that it negatively impacts the performance of the model on new data. under-fitting occurs when a model cannot capture the underlying trend of the data and fails to perform well even on the training data.
